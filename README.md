🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe – Modern UI <br>

A modern, responsive Tic-Tac-Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. <br>
This project allows users to play Player vs Player (PvP) or Player vs AI, with a visually appealing interface, interactive game board, and score tracking. <br><br>

🚀 Features <br>
Game Modes – Choose between Player vs Player and Player vs AI. <br>
Score Tracking – Displays X, O, and Draw scores in real-time. <br>
Turn Indicator – Shows which player's turn it is. <br>
AI Logic – AI plays strategically and blocks potential winning moves. <br>
Visual Feedback – Winning cells glow and highlight the victory. <br>
Restart / Back Options – Reset the game or return to mode selection. <br>
Responsive & Modern UI – Glassmorphism style, hover animations, and clean design. <br><br>

🧠 How It Works <br>
The board is represented as an array of 9 elements. <br>
Players take turns clicking empty cells to mark "X" or "O". <br>
The game checks for a win or draw after each move using winning combinations. <br>
AI mode evaluates the board to either win or block the player. <br>
Scores are updated dynamically, and winning cells are highlighted. <br>
The UI updates using DOM manipulation for cells, scores, and status messages. <br><br>

💡 What I Learned <br>
Through this project, I enhanced my skills in: <br>
JavaScript logic – Building game rules, win conditions, and AI moves. <br>
DOM manipulation – Updating game board, scores, and status dynamically. <br>
Event handling – Managing clicks, button actions, and mode selection. <br>
UI/UX design – Implementing glassmorphism, hover effects, and responsive layouts. <br>
Game development concepts – Turn-based logic, win/draw detection, and AI implementation. <br><br>

📁 Technologies Used <br>
HTML – Structure of the game. <br>
CSS – Styling, animations, and responsive design. <br>
JavaScript  – Game logic, AI, and DOM updates. <br><br>

 Conclusion <br>
This Tic-Tac-Toe project demonstrates interactive web development, JavaScript logic, and modern UI design. <br>
It’s a fun way to practice DOM manipulation, event handling, and building simple AI logic while creating a visually appealing game. <br><br>
